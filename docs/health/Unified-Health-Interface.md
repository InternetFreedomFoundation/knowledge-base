# Unified Health Interface


## Introduction

On 27th May, 2021, a press release from the Prime Minister’s Office mentioned the impending roll-out of the Unified Health Interface (UHI) and characterised its purpose and functioning within the National Digital Health Mission as follows:

_“This interface shall enable public and private solutions and apps to plug in and be a part of National Digital Health Ecosystem. It will allow users to search, book and avail necessary healthcare services such as tele-consultations or laboratory tests. The system will ensure that only verified healthcare providers join the ecosystem. This is likely to unleash a digital health tech revolution with innovations and various services for citizens. In such a manner, healthcare infrastructure and human resources can also be utilised in a more efficient manner across the nation.”_[^1]

On 23rd June, 2021, the NDHM released the consultation paper on the Unified Health Interface (UHI).[^2] The UHI will be the main foundation for the NDHM, and is envisioned to “expand interoperability of health services in India through open protocols”.

## Consultation paper details

The Paper envisioned UHI as “an open protocol for various digital health services” where the UHI open network will comprise two aspects: End User Applications (EUAs) and participating Health Service Provider (HSP) applications. EUAs are the applications that the users will access and can range from mobile apps to virtual assistants using different languages. The HSP applications will be used by health service providers to offer digital health services to users, where these services can include appointment bookings at hospitals / clinics, tele-consultation bookings, checking available critical care beds and nearby pharmacies, ambulance bookings, etc.

The stakeholders mentioned in Chapter 3 of the document include end-users/patients, health service providers (HSPs), and technology service providers. The objectives of the UHI intend that every health service provider gets the opportunity to have their services fairly discovered, only genuine and verified doctors and HSPs participate in the network, financial transactions be transparent and secure for everyone, a feedback system be created, and that there be interoperability of health services, HSPs, and related health data. With an open API network, the UHI allows the application developers to “choose any technology for the development of EUA and HSP applications that can become part of the UHI Network.”

In Section 3.7, the Paper lays out the future scenario for how UHI will re-think and re-develop digital health services in comparison with the current scenarios. For example, in the present scenario, “Chronic patients who require regular care, reminders and review of their medical condition spend an outsized amount of time attending to their chronic condition,” but the UHI network aims to change this by doing the following: “Patients can sign up with Health Bots that will look at their medical history, send reminders, provide advice based on their trends and support doctors in managing chronic care.”

## Responses and Criticism

Several civil society organisations, digital rights groups, and health policy experts responded to the Consultation Paper, including the Internet Freedom Foundation[^3] and IT for Change.[^4]  The responses to the Consultation Paper critiqued it for key issues such as the need for more diverse feedback, the risk of market capture by the private sector, the risk of digital exclusion, financial exploitation and service pricing, and the need for public digital infrastructure.



1. Lack of diverse feedback

    The UHI framework was critiqued for not having public health groups and civil society as stakeholders, neglecting their entrenched and informative position on ground for better implementation of the UHI.

2. Risk of private sector capture

    The possibility of market dominance by existing healthcare apps can be seen as giving them an unfair advantage, nullifying the “fair discoverability” objective.//48 Using the private sector to develop the software for the UHI gateway may result in increased costs for citizens. This will further exacerbate the ability of these players to exploit users through the proposed pricing scheme, due to exorbitant healthcare service costs.

3. Risk of digital exclusion

    Just like the rest of the NDHM, the low internet penetration and digital literacy rates in India have caused experts to believe that there is a lack of digital infrastructural preparation, for which digital literacy schemes and appropriate training processes are needed.

# Health Data Retention Policy


## Introduction

The Health Data Retention Policy (HDRP) is one of the building blocks to realise the National Health Authority’s Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM). It is specified as a necessity in the following clauses of the Health Data Management Policy drafts: Clauses 14, 16.2, 19.2, and 22.2.[^5] [^6] It is intended to lay down the legal provisions for data retention, categorise different types of data, and provide suggestions for data exchange after retention.


## Consultation paper

The HDRP Consultation Paper[^7] was released on November 23, 2021 for public comments and feedback, and the deadline for submission of comments was December 24, 2021.

The introductory chapter of the Paper specifies the purpose for the HDRP in India by stating that it is needed to ensure uniformity in the manner for how health-related sensitive personal data is retained and treated in the process of retention. The ABDM recommends that health data should necessarily be retained in electronic format by all entities participating in the digitisation of India’s healthcare ecosystem, such that health records are easy to retrieve as and when desired by a healthcare entity from interoperable systems, under the HIP/HIU guidelines. Thus, the HDRP is intended to ensure that healthcare facilities comply with all relevant regulations and laws in India in the process of such electronic record-keeping. The Paper further specified that “the Health Data Retention Policy is prospective, not retrospective.”

### The need for HDRP

Patient health information is defined as Sensitive Data under the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011, but no guideline on retention schedule exists. In the absence of any superseding legislations or policies defined on health data retention in the country, many healthcare providers currently comply with self-prescribed standards applicable to their organization for storing, retaining, and maintaining applicable health records, which may cover compliance requirements per state, central or accreditation guidelines.

In the absence of a uniform guideline, and due to lack of understanding of implications of such fragmented retention approaches, the Paper highlights that realising the goals of the ABDM in facilitating long-term health benefits via quality, data-driven digital solutions would be challenging.


### Scope defined in the Paper

The Paper identifies the following scope for the implementation of the HDRP in India:



* A system for compliance with data retention laws/rules/regulations etc.
* Ensuring availability of documents when needed
* Cost, time and space savings to balance storage, security, and infrastructure constraints of health facilities
* Protection against accidental loss or selective record destruction
* Schedule for destruction of non-relevant or obsolete documents

Notably, the Paper recommends that storage, transmission, or any other aspect of processing of personal data be the responsibility of the data fiduciary and over-writing, anonymization or other method(s) of removal or erasure should be made possible on the request of the user.

A significant part of the Consultation Paper is concerned with seeking the correct retention period for the storage of different types of health data. It reviews various privacy and health-related policies from India as well as countries such as the USA, Canada, and UK, among others to discuss this. For instance, it specifies that the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (now the Data Protection Bill 2021) has the provision that data can be stored only for as long as it is necessary to satisfy the purpose for which the data has been recorded by the entity.


### Responses and Criticism

Digital rights groups, healthcare policy experts, and civil society organisations responded to the HDRP Consultation Paper as well as the plan intended to digitise healthcare records in India, critiquing issues of implementation, lack of a data protection law, and concerns of low digital literacy in relation to informed patient consent for data retention practices. Internet Freedom Foundation,[^8] IT for Change,[^9] and _The Hindu’s _Ameya Ashok Naik,[^10] were some of the prominent commentators on the HDRP and its Consultation Paper.



1. Manner of implementation:

    Due to deficiencies in India’s digital infrastructure, experts recommended that the implementation of the HDRP should be supported by relevant capacity-building measures as any form of implementation without resolving issues of low digital literacy[^11] [^12] [^13] and cybersecurity can cause more harm than benefit through large-scale digitisation.  Research evaluating current electronic health record systems in India have highlighted deficiencies in the existing processes used for data record-keeping.[^14] [^15] [^16]



2. Data retention periods for various classes of data:

    As the intention of the HDRP is to facilitate interoperability in usage of retained health data, the policy might be inclined to store data for longer periods of time but consultation responses emphasised that this storage period must be strictly determined through freely given, informed, specific, and valid patient consent that may be withdrawn at any time. However, such extensions must be limited to a period of one year at a time, after which explicit consent must be obtained once again.

3. Lack of a nation-wide data protection legislation

    As India currently lacks a comprehensive data protection law, rights groups have objected to how the HDRP may be lacking in proper and robust legal ground in protecting retained health data, which is sensitive and private in nature. Internet Freedom Foundation highlighted how the World Health Assembly, in 2018, recognised the potential for digitised healthcare systems, but also called upon its member states to develop a robust legislation to mitigate and handle issues of data access, sharing, consent, security, privacy, and inclusivity.[^17] sharing, consent, security, privacy, and inclusivity.[^17]
